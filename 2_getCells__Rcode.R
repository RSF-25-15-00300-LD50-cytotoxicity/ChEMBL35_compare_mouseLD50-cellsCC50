#### The data have to be completed with the following fields:

### Progeny of the cells
## Gather cell_source_tissue to the progenies from https://data.humancellatlas.org/:
# Adipose
# Breast
# Development (embryos, fetuses and all) -> distinct parameter
# Eye
# Genetic diversity (?) - human cells within complex tissues are highly variable, influenced by genetics, age, sex, and environment.
# Gut
# Heart and Vascular
# Immune
# Kidney
# Liver
# Lung
# Musculoskeletal
# Nervous system
# Oral and Craniofacial
# Organoid (?) - three-dimensional structures of cells that recapitulate organ development in vitro â€“ hold tremendous potential for biomedical applications.
# Pancreas
# Reproduction
# Skin 
## -> more ore less in line

### Type of the cells corresponding to the degree of their deviation from normal human cells
## Normal human cells does not last in culture long, thus the studies are often conducted using established cultures of somehow transformed cells OR cells having limited number of divisions left.
## Cellosaurus is the basic source of this information, accessed on 10.09.2025 & 11.09.2025
# finite - normal cells having limited lifespan, including primary cells, which are finite cells, which have just been obtained from the source
# transformed - more or less normal cells, which obtained the prolonged lifespan during transformation in vitro (spontaneous, viral or induced by chemicals)
# cancer - cancer cell lines, not normal at all

### Developmental stage
## Cells obtained on the developmental stage may deviate from the normal somehow; applies only to the non-cancerous cell lines
# 1  - developmental stage
# NA - no clear indication on the developmental stage was found


### It should be that there is some degree of ambiguity in the cell's characteristics.
### For example, PRIMARY and FINITE cells derived from them may have the same `NAME` in different sources.
### PBMC is cummulative `NAME`
